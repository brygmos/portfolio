          Hi, i&#39;m a frontend developer with a love for creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
          I specialize in crafting responsive and interactive web experiences. 
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
          My main focus these days intensively studying technologies related to website development, and I don&#39;t intend to stop!
          When I&#39;m not at computer I cook, fix something or watch movie. My sports activities are badminton and cycling ðŸš²
